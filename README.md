Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its attributes. This can be helpful for car buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts to estimate the value of a car.

The project follows the following steps:

Data Preparation: The dataset is preprocessed, handling missing values, categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Model Training: A machine learning model is selected and trained using the prepared dataset. The project uses a linear regression algorithm from scikit-learn, but other regression algorithms can also be explored.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared score.

Prediction: The model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data, providing estimated car prices based on their attributes.
